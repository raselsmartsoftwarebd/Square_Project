            SQUARE promises to make a better and greener Bangladesh. Our approach to environmental management enables us to detect and avoid potential environmental impacts at an early stage. The environmental plans contain a clear set of objectives and concrete activities to be carried out as per the guideline set by the national regulatory bodies and ISO. Its manufacturing plants have instituted an internationally accepted Environmental Management System to restrict pollution activities.

        </p>

        <p>
